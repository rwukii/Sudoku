# Sudoku
This is a very simple version of Sudoku I've made for my very first big assignment at uni. The game created using C++ and SDL library.
# Requirements
 - CodeBlocks/Microsoft Visual Studio/any code programs.
 - SDL2 and SDL_ttf2 (already included)
# Gameplay and Features
Not much things to say, this version of Sudoku is not so different with the og's Sudoku that we've all known.
 - The game creates random numbers on a 9x9 white-board.
 - "Check" button to see if you are doing good, or not. Maybe not.
# Future plans for this game/Possible things to add
 - A timer to make the game more intense
 - Music/sounds. Of course.
 - Improve the quality of all the resources (the background, the quality,...)
 - A well-designed menu, with more difficulties (3x3, 6x6,...)
# Notices (these won't exists if my coding skills isn't bad, will try to fix it later)
 - When you complete the game, it won't show the congratulations screen right away. You must click the "Check" button and wait for around 3-5 secs.
 - On the mean time, it will shows some red blocks, shows that these numbers are wrong. Please attention that you are not, it's a bug that i can't figure out how to fix it *yet*.
 - Sometimes, it will show you the same Sudoku puzzle even when you've completed it before. This is also a bug that I've not fixed *yet*.
